Highlights widget	
==
A widget used to feature a bit of text in a sidebar on a wordpress blog

Customizable:
* title
* link
* background color (limited selection right now)
* text color (limited selection right now)
* drop shadow color (limited selection right now)
* margin
* padding
* font size

A highlight can be disabled without removing it from the sidebar in the backend.
I know that wordpress includes an area to keep inactive widgets, but when this was originally designed this feature was requested
